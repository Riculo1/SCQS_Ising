Project: Domain walls and bound states in the one-dimensional quantum Ising model

You will use tensor network techniques (based on matrix product states) to study the
spectrum of excitations in the quantum Ising model with transverse magnetic field. In
addition, it might also be interesting to study the spectrum of bound kink-antikink states
that emerges when a longitudinal field is added that explicitly breaks the Z2 symmetry.
